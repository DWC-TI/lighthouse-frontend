# 🚦 Lighthouse Project – Full System Overview & Plan

---

## Core Principles

- **Modular by design:** Every feature (cards, manual, data, projects) is a module—easy to add, remove, or expand.
- **Self-driven, scalable:** Built for your workflow first, SaaS-ready in the background.
- **Lighthouse method:** Creative flow, clarity, beacons, return points, domains of life—always at the center.

---

## What’s Built & Ready

### 1. Modular Dashboard
- Each “card” is a separate HTML file (energy, creative flow, agenda, check-in, beacon, blind spot, etc.)
- Cards load dynamically into dashboard rows.
- Floating Keeper button (🧙‍♂️) and Manual button (❓), both as modals or pages.
- Theme: Lighthouse color palette, responsive, card animations, dot color logic.

### 2. Manual
- Modular manual: sidebar index, search, and each section as its own HTML file.
- Sections: Welcome, Dashboard Guide, Cards Explained, Energy & Flow, Check-In Routine, FAQ—expandable anytime.
- Quick to update, easy to export/share for onboarding or help.

### 3. Data Layer
- All “real data” in local modular JSON files:  
  - `/project/checkins.json`  
  - `/project/agenda.json`  
  - `/project/domains.json`  
  - `/project/notes.json`  
  - *(and more as needed: projects/sprints.json, etc.)*
- JSON-first approach:  
  - Each check-in, agenda event, note, etc. is a JSON object.
  - You can upload any of these here for review or analysis.

### 4. Visualization & Logic
- 7-day creative flow chart: dots/lines, color-coded (green/yellow/red).
- Low-energy/momentum watcher logic: shows alerts/nudges if trends go downward.
- Keeper tips and manual content are always one click away.

### 5. Flexible Review & Feedback
- Upload any JSON file for insights, merging, or trend analysis.
- Your process: do a check-in with GPT → copy-paste JSON block into your local file → refresh dashboard.
- All cards and views can “join” multiple files (check-ins + agenda + domains, etc.) for custom views.

## What’s Planned / In Progress

### 6. Project & Sprint Management
- Add modular UI/card for projects and sprints:
  - List projects (with goal, domains, status)
  - View and edit sprints and their tasks
  - Mark progress, complete, or move between sprints
  - Export/import for backups or SaaS migration

### 7. Onboarding Wizard
- Modal or multi-step flow to:
  - Define domains of life
  - Set initial action points/goals per domain
  - Quick “start using” experience for new users

### 8. Agenda / Weekly Beam
- Modular agenda/task view (add/edit tasks, see this week’s events)
- Export to .ics (calendar file) or CSV
- (Future) Connect to Google/iCloud if needed, but start with local + export

### 9. Business/Team Expansion (for SaaS)
- Optional “business” module/section for multiple users, projects, or shared views.
- All logic and data structure is SaaS-ready, but no pressure to build now.

### 10. Advanced Analytics & Reflection
- Reports: trends across domains, longest beam streaks, check-in patterns.
- Suggestions/nudges from the Keeper based on your own data.
- Modular exports for marketing, sharing, or reflection.

## SaaS & Scale Readiness

- Data structure and code style are already SaaS-ready (just swap fetch to API).
- Permissions, user IDs, and multi-user logic can be added later.
- “Export/import everything” is already baked in for migration or sharing.
- SaaS Readiness Checklist saved for future use.

## Your System Folder Structure

```
/project/
  ├── checkins.json
  ├── agenda.json
  ├── domains.json
  ├── notes.json
  ├── projects.json         # (planned)
  ├── SaaS-Checklist.md
  ├── ProjectPlan.md
  └── ... (manual sections, exports, logs)
```

## How You Work

- **Check-in, plan, or review** → Get a ready-to-paste JSON snippet → Update your local file → View progress/trends instantly
- **Upload any file or folder** for custom analysis, code, or feedback
- **Add features at your own pace**—UI, manual, alerts, onboarding, agenda, etc.
- **When ready:**  
  - Add backend (Strapi/n8n) and authentication  
  - Instantly SaaS, no rebuild needed!

## Next Steps (Suggest Order)
1. (Optional) Project/Sprint UI (modular card + JSON)
2. Onboarding Wizard (modal or stepper card)
3. Agenda/Beam view (with export)
4. Advanced analytics, review, and Keeper upgrades
5. (Future) Team/business features & SaaS launch

You have a “living” OS for creative work and growth, 100% modular and always ready to grow with you.
